# EulerianGraphs
A JS app that works with Eulerian cycles and paths.

## Notes
It was created for an assignment at my university, TU-Sofia. Here's the assignment, translated:
> Given any graph G, create an app that:
> - check if there is an Eulerian cycle;
> - checks if a finite sequence of vertices P is an Eulerian path in the graph G;
> - finds all Eulerian paths in the graph;
> - finds all Eulerian cycles in the graph (if any are available);
> visualizes the graph, the paths and the cycles.
