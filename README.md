# EulerianGraphs
A JS app that deals with Eulerian cycles and paths. It works for both undirected and directed graphs.

## Notes
- It was created for an assignment at my university, TU-Sofia. Here's the assignment, translated:
    > Given any graph G, create an app that:
    > - check if there is an Eulerian cycle;
    > - checks if a finite sequence of vertices P is an Eulerian path in the graph G;
    > - finds all Eulerian paths in the graph;
    > - finds all Eulerian cycles in the graph (if any are available);
    > - visualizes the graph, the paths and the cycles.
- Unfortunately, it may not be able to find all the possible Eulerian cycles and paths, especially in larger undirected graphs. [This explains why.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eulerian_path#Complexity_issues)
